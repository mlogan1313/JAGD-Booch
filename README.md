# Kombucha Lab â€“ Pilot Production and Scaling Project

Welcome to the **Kombucha Lab**, a repository for documenting the full lifecycle of professional-grade kombucha production using brewery-style equipment, precision logging, and scalable workflows.

This project is designed to support:
- Clean, repeatable kombucha production at a 10-gallon scale
- Scientific batch tracking and fermentation control
- Integration with fermentation tech (e.g. glycol chillers, carbonation stones, sensors)
- App development for daily use and data entry
