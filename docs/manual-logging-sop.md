# Manual Logging SOP – Kombucha Lab

This guide outlines best practices for manually tracking kombucha production data without automation or sensors.

## 🧪 pH Measurement

### Equipment:
- Calibrated digital pH meter (e.g., Apera, Hanna)
- Calibration solutions: pH 4.0 and 7.0

### Process:
- Calibrate meter weekly or before each batch
- Record pH:
  - After adding starter (Day 0)
  - Daily during 1F
  - After flavoring (optional)
  - After carbonation (optional)

---

## 🌡️ Temperature Tracking

### Tools:
- Instant-read thermometer
- Optional: thermowell or in-line digital probe

### Process:
- Measure and log:
  - Wort temp after brewing and before pitching starter
  - Daily fermentation liquid temp during 1F
  - Ambient room temp during 1F and 2F
  - Liquid temp before carbonation

---

## 🕒 Time & Duration

### Record:
- Date/time of:
  - Tea steeping and sugar addition
  - Cooling complete
  - SCOBY/starter addition
  - Transfer to 2F
  - Carbonation start and end
  - Kegging or bottling

---

## 🍊 Flavoring Notes

### Track:
- Exact ingredient names, brands, and volumes (cups, oz, grams)
- Juice vs puree vs syrup
- Taste notes: sweetness, acidity, body, aroma
- Color and appearance before and after carbonation

---

## 🧴 Packaging Logs

### For Each Batch:
- PSI and temp used for carbonation
- Carbonation duration
- Kegging or bottling details
- Notes on clarity, sediment, foaminess, and head retention

## 🧾 Suggested Daily Log Format (for Sheet or Markdown)

| Date | pH | Liquid Temp (°F) | Ambient Temp | Notes |
|------|----|------------------|---------------|--------|
|      |    |                  |               |        |

Happy brewing and logging!
